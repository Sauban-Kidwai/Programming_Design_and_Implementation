**DESCRIPTION** : COMP1007 - Programming Design and Implementation (Semester 1 2023)

<br>

Designed and implemented a Java application that will allow users to interrogate data to understand Indigenous community infrastructure projects throughout the different Canadian provinces in 2023 based on the datasets from this link

https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/62155d6f-9167-4972-b77c-b90734b628dc

The data was provided to us in a `.csv` format. I was tasked to first make pseudocode to have an idea and a plan as to how I will make the program (which are the `.txt` files) and the actual code are in the `.java` files.
